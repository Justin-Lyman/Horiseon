# Horiseon Web Services


## Description

- The goal of this project was to streamline the code, and provide an updated search engine optimization.
- This updated code solves the issue of having little traction in the search engine, aswell as optimizing the style sheet to be more effecient.
- As a developer I've learned ways to implement tags and VS code tools like >, #, and . to make the style sheet and html sheet effecient, Non-redundant and Semantic.
